hello, this is me learning how to use hand-tracking in a number of cool projects using a tutorial
by freecodecamp.org in which it is being taught by Murtaza's Workshop channel.

you will need some modules which will be:
1. media pipe (command:- pip install mediapipe)
2. cv2 (command:- pip install opencv-python)
