hello, this is me learning how to use hand-tracking in a number of cool projects using a tutorial
by freecodecamp.org in which it is being taught by Murtaza's Workshop channel.

you will need some modules which will be:
1. media pipe (command:- pip install mediapipe)
2. cv2 (command:- pip install opencv-python)

file 1:
main.py: contains code for normal handtracking

file 2:
poseEsti.py: contains code for pose estimation, for that you will require an mp4 video which will be added, you can use that
or another one of your choice

file 3:
face_recog.py: contains code for face recognition

file 4:
face_mesh.py: contains code for face mesh
